#### 5.3.2. Customizing the Management Server Port

Exposing management endpoints by using the default HTTP port is a sensible choice for cloud-based deployments. If, however, your application runs inside your own data center, you may prefer to expose endpoints by using a different HTTP port.

You can set the `management.server.port` property to change the HTTP port, as shown in the following example:

```properties
management.server.port=8081
```

> On Cloud Foundry, applications only receive requests on port 8080 for both HTTP and TCP routing, by default. If you want to use a custom management port on Cloud Foundry, you will need to explicitly set up the applicationâ€™s routes to forward traffic to the custom port.

#### 5.3.3. Configuring Management-specific SSL

When configured to use a custom port, the management server can also be configured with its own SSL by using the various `management.server.ssl.*` properties. For example, doing so lets a management server be available over HTTP while the main application uses HTTPS, as shown in the following property settings:

```properties
server.port=8443
server.ssl.enabled=true
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:store.jks
server.ssl.key-password=secret
management.server.port=8080
management.server.ssl.enabled=false
```

Alternatively, both the main server and the management server can use SSL but with different key stores, as follows:

```properties
server.port=8443
server.ssl.enabled=true
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:main.jks
server.ssl.key-password=secret
management.server.port=8080
management.server.ssl.enabled=true
management.server.ssl.key-store=classpath:management.jks
management.server.ssl.key-password=secret
```
