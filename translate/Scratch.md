#### 4.7.3. JAX-RS and Jersey

If you prefer the JAX-RS programming model for REST endpoints, you can use one of the available implementations instead of Spring MVC. [Jersey](https://jersey.github.io/) and [Apache CXF](https://cxf.apache.org/) work quite well out of the box. CXF requires you to register its `Servlet` or `Filter` as a `@Bean` in your application context. Jersey has some native Spring support, so we also provide auto-configuration support for it in Spring Boot, together with a starter.

To get started with Jersey, include the `spring-boot-starter-jersey` as a dependency and then you need one `@Bean` of type `ResourceConfig` in which you register all the endpoints, as shown in the following example:

```java
@Component
public class JerseyConfig extends ResourceConfig {

    public JerseyConfig() {
        register(Endpoint.class);
    }

}
```

> Jerseyâ€™s support for scanning executable archives is rather limited. For example, it cannot scan for endpoints in a package found in a [fully executable jar file](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.2.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment-install) or in `WEB-INF/classes` when running an executable war file. To avoid this limitation, the `packages` method should not be used, and endpoints should be registered individually by using the `register` method, as shown in the preceding example.

For more advanced customizations, you can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement `ResourceConfigCustomizer`.

All the registered endpoints should be `@Components` with HTTP resource annotations (`@GET` and others), as shown in the following example:

```java
@Component
@Path("/hello")
public class Endpoint {

    @GET
    public String message() {
        return "Hello";
    }

}
```

Since the `Endpoint` is a Spring `@Component`, its lifecycle is managed by Spring and you can use the `@Autowired` annotation to inject dependencies and use the `@Value` annotation to inject external configuration. By default, the Jersey servlet is registered and mapped to `/*`. You can change the mapping by adding `@ApplicationPath` to your `ResourceConfig`.

By default, Jersey is set up as a Servlet in a `@Bean` of type `ServletRegistrationBean` named `jerseyServletRegistration`. By default, the servlet is initialized lazily, but you can customize that behavior by setting `spring.jersey.servlet.load-on-startup`. You can disable or override that bean by creating one of your own with the same name. You can also use a filter instead of a servlet by setting `spring.jersey.type=filter` (in which case, the `@Bean` to replace or override is `jerseyFilterRegistration`). The filter has an `@Order`, which you can set with `spring.jersey.filter.order`. Both the servlet and the filter registrations can be given init parameters by using `spring.jersey.init.*` to specify a map of properties.
