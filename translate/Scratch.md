### 4.13. Messaging

The Spring Framework provides extensive support for integrating with messaging systems, from simplified use of the JMS API using `JmsTemplate` to a complete infrastructure to receive messages asynchronously. Spring AMQP provides a similar feature set for the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. Spring Boot also provides auto-configuration options for `RabbitTemplate` and RabbitMQ. Spring WebSocket natively includes support for STOMP messaging, and Spring Boot has support for that through starters and a small amount of auto-configuration. Spring Boot also has support for Apache Kafka.

#### 4.13.1. JMS

The `javax.jms.ConnectionFactory` interface provides a standard method of creating a `javax.jms.Connection` for interacting with a JMS broker. Although Spring needs a `ConnectionFactory` to work with JMS, you generally need not use it directly yourself and can instead rely on higher level messaging abstractions. (See the [relevant section](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.2.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#jms) of the Spring Framework reference documentation for details.) Spring Boot also auto-configures the necessary infrastructure to send and receive messages.

##### ActiveMQ Support

When [ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/) is available on the classpath, Spring Boot can also configure a `ConnectionFactory`. If the broker is present, an embedded broker is automatically started and configured (provided no broker URL is specified through configuration).

> If you use `spring-boot-starter-activemq`, the necessary dependencies to connect or embed an ActiveMQ instance are provided, as is the Spring infrastructure to integrate with JMS.

ActiveMQ configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in `spring.activemq.*`. For example, you might declare the following section in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.activemq.broker-url=tcp://192.168.1.210:9876
spring.activemq.user=admin
spring.activemq.password=secret
```

By default, a `CachingConnectionFactory` wraps the native `ConnectionFactory` with sensible settings that you can control by external configuration properties in `spring.jms.*`:

```properties
spring.jms.cache.session-cache-size=5
```

If youâ€™d rather use native pooling, you can do so by adding a dependency to `org.messaginghub:pooled-jms` and configuring the `JmsPoolConnectionFactory` accordingly, as shown in the following example:

```properties
spring.activemq.pool.enabled=true
spring.activemq.pool.max-connections=50
```

> See [`ActiveMQProperties`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.2.2.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jms/activemq/ActiveMQProperties.java) for more of the supported options. You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement `ActiveMQConnectionFactoryCustomizer` for more advanced customizations.

By default, ActiveMQ creates a destination if it does not yet exist so that destinations are resolved against their provided names.
