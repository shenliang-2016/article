The Java programming language uses *exceptions* to handle errors and other exceptional events. This lesson describes when and how to use exceptions.

## [What Is an Exception?](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/definition.html)

An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.

## [The Catch or Specify Requirement](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/catchOrDeclare.html)

This section covers how to catch and handle exceptions. The discussion includes the `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks, as well as chained exceptions and logging.

## [How to Throw Exceptions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/throwing.html)

This section covers the `throw` statement and the `Throwable` class and its subclasses.

## [The try-with-resources Statement](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html)

This section describes the `try`-with-resources statement, which is a `try` statement that declares one or more resources. A resource is as an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it. The `try`-with-resources statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement.

## [Unchecked Exceptions â€” The Controversy](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/runtime.html)

This section explains the correct and incorrect use of the unchecked exceptions indicated by subclasses of `RuntimeException`.

## [Advantages of Exceptions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/advantages.html)

The use of exceptions to manage errors has some advantages over traditional error-management techniques. You'll learn more in this section.
