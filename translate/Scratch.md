### 5.9. Process Monitoring

In the `spring-boot` module, you can find two classes to create files that are often useful for process monitoring:

- `ApplicationPidFileWriter` creates a file containing the application PID (by default, in the application directory with a file name of `application.pid`).
- `WebServerPortFileWriter` creates a file (or files) containing the ports of the running web server (by default, in the application directory with a file name of `application.port`).

By default, these writers are not activated, but you can enable:

- [By Extending Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.6.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-process-monitoring-configuration)
- [Programmatically](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.6.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-process-monitoring-programmatically)

#### 5.9.1. Extending Configuration

In the `META-INF/spring.factories` file, you can activate the listener(s) that writes a PID file, as shown in the following example:

```
org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener=\
org.springframework.boot.context.ApplicationPidFileWriter,\
org.springframework.boot.web.context.WebServerPortFileWriter
```

#### 5.9.2. Programmatically

You can also activate a listener by invoking the `SpringApplication.addListeners(â€¦)` method and passing the appropriate `Writer` object. This method also lets you customize the file name and path in the `Writer` constructor.
