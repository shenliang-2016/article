##### `autoconfigure` Module

The `autoconfigure` module contains everything that is necessary to get started with the library. It may also contain configuration key definitions (such as `@ConfigurationProperties`) and any callback interface that can be used to further customize how the components are initialized.

>  You should mark the dependencies to the library as optional so that you can include the `autoconfigure` module in your projects more easily. If you do it that way, the library is not provided and, by default, Spring Boot backs off.

Spring Boot uses an annotation processor to collect the conditions on auto-configurations in a metadata file (`META-INF/spring-autoconfigure-metadata.properties`). If that file is present, it is used to eagerly filter auto-configurations that do not match, which will improve startup time. It is recommended to add the following dependency in a module that contains auto-configurations:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-autoconfigure-processor</artifactId>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```

With Gradle 4.5 and earlier, the dependency should be declared in the `compileOnly` configuration, as shown in the following example:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure-processor"
}
```

With Gradle 4.6 and later, the dependency should be declared in the `annotationProcessor` configuration, as shown in the following example:

```groovy
dependencies {
    annotationProcessor "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure-processor"
}
```

##### Starter Module

The starter is really an empty jar. Its only purpose is to provide the necessary dependencies to work with the library. You can think of it as an opinionated view of what is required to get started.

Do not make assumptions about the project in which your starter is added. If the library you are auto-configuring typically requires other starters, mention them as well. Providing a proper set of *default* dependencies may be hard if the number of optional dependencies is high, as you should avoid including dependencies that are unnecessary for a typical usage of the library. In other words, you should not include optional dependencies.

>  Either way, your starter must reference the core Spring Boot starter (`spring-boot-starter`) directly or indirectly (i.e. no need to add it if your starter relies on another starter). If a project is created with only your custom starter, Spring Bootâ€™s core features will be honoured by the presence of the core starter.
